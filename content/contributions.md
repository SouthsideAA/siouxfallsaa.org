## 7th Tradition

The Seventh Tradition of Alcoholics Anonymous states that "Every A.A. group ought
to be fully self-supporting, declining outside contributions."  This means that
only A.A. members contribute financially to A.A.

Groups that collect 7th Tradition money are encouraged to share a portion of these
[contributions](https://www.aa.org/aa-contributions-self-support) with G.S.O. and
their representing district.
